It is assumed you have everything installed and working by now.
Remember to turn on the resource pack.

First of all you can change the scrolling sounds by pressing escape, options, music and sounds, and in the top right corner click sounds.
Click UI sounds and click Hotbar Scroll. Change it off, if you wish. There are plenty of other settings here too.
Another thing you'll notice is the ambience. If it's too loud for you, type "/cmdclientconfig" in chat and hit "General". You can change the volume there.
Pressing M will open the world map. I wouldn't recommend viewing the underground layers, its slightly cheaty, which I tried to avoid when making the pack but oh well.

Anyway here's some patch notes:

UI:
- HUD retextured. Look at those hearts and armor.
- UI items now make sounds when selected.
- UI items will now expand when hovered over.
- Scrolling is now smooth.
- Rare tier or higher items such as enchanted items will now leave a trail when moved.
- Hunger bar has been replaced with a food item players actually use, steaks.
- Tool state visibly changes with use.
- Durability values are now displayed when hovering over an item.
- Hunger amount is now displayed when hovering over food.
- Campfires have an animated sprite in the inventory.
- A cheatsheet has been added to the brewing stand UI.
- Text chat has a few animations to make it smoother.
- Fixed sprite misalignment for buckets of different types
