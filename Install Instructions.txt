Hello. This pack introduces multiple small changes that make Minecraft a more modern, more playable, and less annoying experience.

To INSTALL:

Navigate to C:\Users\<Your User>\AppData\Roaming\.Minecraft  folder. Pin it to quick access for later in the file explorer.

Drop the "Vanilla Updates" folder into the "Resourcepacks" folder. You will load this resource pack when you launch Minecraft.

For the mods you will need the latest version of Fabric. For anyone new to modding, don't worry. Fabric is essentially a barebones mod loader. It's safe, and open source (Trust me I'm in IT).
So for Fabric, visit: "https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/", click download for windows, open your downloads folder and double click the JAR file to launch it.

(!!!HELP THAT JAR FILE WON'T LAUNCH!!!)

Worry not. You just don't have Java installed. Go to "https://www.java.com/en/" and download it there, same deal double click it and install, then install fabric above.

ALMOST DONE!

Cool, now that it's all done, open the mods folder and copy all the mods into the /Minecraft mods folder. These are the ones that will be loaded. If you want the world map, drop that in there too.

Now open the Minecraft launcher, select Fabric as the version of Minecraft you launch (like selecting a different update) in the dropdown, then play.

You are now done. Please enjoy, and read the settings.txt!
